Chlorophyll is a green pigment present in plants and algae that absorbs sunlight in photosynthesis. It is responsible for the green color of leaves. It uses water and carbon dioxide to produce glucose. It is contained inside chloroplast.,"Chlorophyll is the green pigment present in all the green plants and trees and in some algae as well. It is responsible for the green color of the plants. An arrangement of chlorophyll in groups is known as chloroplast. It absorbs sunlight, which is one of the most important thing for photosynthesis.  Inside every plant cell are chloroplasts. They contain a green pigment called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll conducts photosynthesis. That is the process which uses water and carbon dioxide to produce glucose. Plants use glucose for energy.

"Chlorophyll is a pigment present in photosynthetic organisms which absorbs sunlight and produces glucose. They are arranged around photosystems, contained in chloroplasts. There are different types of chlorophylls.","Chlorophyll is a pigment present in photosynthetic organisms like plants,algae and cyanobacteria. It has light harvesting centers where the sunlight is absorbed at different frequencies and a multi-step enzymatic breakdown takes place to yield glucose. There are different types of chlorophyll based on the biochemical properties. Chlorophyll molecules are specifically arranged in and around pigment protein complexes called photosystems, which are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.

"Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. It absorbs light from the sun and produces glucose with the help of carbon dioxide and water.","Chlorophyll is a green photosynthetic pigment found in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Chlorophyll mostly absorbs most of the colors of the electromagnetic spectrum except green which is why it appears green in color. It traps light energy from the sun, which is then used to combine carbon dioxide and water into sugars by the process of photosynthesis .Chlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis, as it helps plants get energy from light."
"Chlorophyll is a green pigment responsible for the colour of leaves. It contains Magnesium as the central atom, and is crucial for the process of photosynthesis. It is found in chloroplasts. There are several kinds of chlorophyll.","Chlorophyll is a green colour pigment which is responsible for the colour of the leaves. It is a very important coordination compound, in which Magnesium is the central atom. It is very crucial in the process of Photosynthesis. And thus, it is one of those compounds which sustains life on earth. They are found in thylakoids membranes of chloroplasts. Chlorophyll is a chlorin pigment. Various kinds of chlorophyll are
Chlorophyll A, Chlorophyll B, Chlorophyll C1, Chlorophyll C2, Chlorophyll D, Chlorophyll F.
A and B are well known. F is found in cyanobacteria.

It is a green pigment present in chloroplasts. It is used in photosynthesis to synthesize light to produce byproducts. It contains a non-ionic magnesium atom at the head.,"It's a green pigment which is present in the chloroplasts in the leaves. This pigment is used in the process of photosynthesis to trap and synthesize the sun light and to produce by products. A chlorophyll molecule has a tadpole like structure which consists of a porphyrin head with a phytol tail. The porphyrin head is a cyclic tetrapyrrolic structure with a non-ionic magnesium atom and the phytol tail of hydrocarbons is attached to the ring structure.

"It is a green pigment present in all green plants, used for the absorption of light to provide energy for photosynthesis. It contains a magnesium atom  in a porphyrin ring and is a magnesium complex compound. It is essential for plants to initiate photosynthesis.","a green pigment, present in all green plants and in cyanobacteria, responsible for the absorption of light to provide energy for photosynthesis. Its molecule contains a magnesium atom held in a porphyrin ring. Chlorophyll is a compound which makes us to realize about coordination compounds. It is a magnesium complex compound. it is very much found in plants and a material to initiate photosynthesis under other conditions like sun,water are satisfied

"Chlorophyll is a green pigment present in plants and algae, and is responsible for the absorption of sunlight in photosynthesis. It uses sunlight along with carbon dioxide and water to produce sugars. It is arranged around photosystems and present in chloroplasts.","Chlorophyll is a green pigment present in plants (autotrophic unicellular organisms like algae also) which is responsible for the absorbtion of specific wavelength of the sunlight and thus, helps in the process of photosynthesis . Green substance in producers that traps light energy from the sun, which is then used to combine carbon dioxide and water into sugars in the process of photosynthesis Chlorophyll is vital for photosynthesis, which helps plants get energy from light.

Chlorophyll molecules are specifically arranged in and around pigment protein complexes called photosystems, which are embedded in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.

"It is a green pigment responsible for leaves green color. It is an organic molecule containing Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen with magnesium in the central ring. It is capable of turning sun's energy into chemical energy.","The Green pigment in plants which are responsible for leaves green color is known as chlorophyll. If the color of leaves is not green , that means chlorophyll is not present, instead other color pigment may be present, which may be red/ yellow in color. Chlorophyll is an organic molecule containing Carbon ,hydrogen , oxygen and magnesium in the central ring e.g C55H72O5Mg. It is a bio organic molecule capable of fixing photons of Sun's energy and into chemical energy

"Chlorophyll is a green pigment present in chloroplasts which turns sunlight during thr day time and involves in photosynthesis. It is composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and magnesium. ","Chlorophyll is a green pigment present in the grana of chloroplast which traps the sunlight during the day time and involves in the light reaction which is a step in photosynthesis carried out by green parts of the plant. It is a highly complex substance composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and magnesium. Chloroplasts are mainly contained in the mesophyll cells located between the upper and lower epidermis (palisade and spongy cells) of leaves
