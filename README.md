# Application of Transformer-Based models for Exam Evaluation Systems
## My final year project that automatically scans the exam sheets, learns from it, and evaluates automatically!
The Proposed System consists of the following components:
- Computer Vision Component
- NLP Component
- Result Component
  
The **Computer Vision Component** is responsible for scanning the answer sheets.
The **NLP Component** is responsible for processing the answer and evaluating it.
The **Result Component** is responsible for checking the synonyms and assigning marks.

## To run the project...
1) Either run the [index.js](index.js) file and use *postman* to send requests to the 'predict' route
2) Run the Jupyter Notebooks in the notebooks folder
